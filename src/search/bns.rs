//! Contains an implementation of Best Node Search, a fuzzy search algorithm, which uses multiple
//! zero-window Negamax calls to find the best move.
//!
//! # Algorithm:
//! Best Node Search is an algorithm detailed in 2011 which uses several zero-window Negamax
//! searches to find the best move. It is a "fuzzified" algorithm, meaning that it doesn't
//! necessarily find the exact score for any of the moves, but instead determines which move is
//! best by finding the score which only one move exceeds. This is done by setting search bounds,
//! guessing what score will separate one move, then performing zero-window searches on each move.
//! The bounds and guess are tweaked, and the process is repeated until the best move is found.
//!
//! This algorithm is a theoretical improvement over standard Negamax and NegaScout because with a
//! relatively accurate guess, multiple moves can be discarded with a relatively fast zero-window
//! search. The algorithm benefits from accurate upper and lower bounds, and statistical tuning of
//! guessing from the bounds.
//!
//! # Implementation:
//! The Best Node Search implemented in this module is a slight modification of the one presented
//! in the original paper, with some small improvements. It uses the negamax implementation from
//! the `negamax` package for its zero-window searches. The main modification made to the
//! implementation described in the paper is that moves which are below a cutoff are discarded as
//! long as at least one move is greater than the cutoff. This means that once a move is known to
//! not be the best, it is never searched again.
